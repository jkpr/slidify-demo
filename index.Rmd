## First slide

*** left

1. Slidify is fun
2. It has pretty transitions
3. It is easy to include math (put `mathjax` into the widgets list)
4. It is easy to include R code
5. The source file is very simple as it includes minimal markup tags (this is also a drawback because it may not be possible to make the slides exactly as you want)

*** right

## R code and $\LaTeX$ demonstration

A well known equation in math involving $\pi$ (which is known to be `r pi`) is the following

$$
\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots
$$

Plotting with `plot()` the partial sums and the value of $\pi/4$ gives

```{r plot-pi, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# echo=FALSE means to not show the code but show the results
# echo=TRUE means show the code and the results

num <- rep(c(1,-1),10)
denom <- (1:20*2)-1
terms <- num/denom
partial_sums <- cumsum(terms)

plot(1:20, partial_sums, type="l", 
     main=expression("Convergence of a series towards "*pi/4), 
     xlab="Number of terms", 
     ylab="Value")
abline(a=pi/4, b=0, col="red")
```
